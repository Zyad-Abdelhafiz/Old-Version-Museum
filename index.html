                <h3><span>THE RHYTHM OF THE NILE</span> <br> <br>
                    Tutankhamun’s story begins in ancient Egypt, a land shaped by the seasonal changes to the Nile
                    River. All life in Egypt depended on the river—the Nile provided food and natural resources, land
                    for crops, a “road” for travel, and a means to transport materials and merchandise.</h3>

                <h3><span>Seasonal Surge</span> <br> <br>
                    The flooding of the Nile has been an important natural cycle in Egypt since ancient times. Heavy
                    rains
                    from the Ethiopian highlands would cause the waters to begin rising in June, flooding the Nile
                    Valley
                    and depositing nutrient-rich soil. This surge transformed the desert into productive farmland. The
                    river’s predictability allowed the Egyptians to build an empire based on agricultural wealth. They
                    grew
                    staple food crops—such as wheat and barley—and industrial crops—such as flax and papyrus. Farmers
                    developed a complex irrigation system, digging channels to direct floodwaters and saturating soil to
                    make it ready for planting. Riverbank mud was baked into bricks for building structures.

                <h3><span>Monumental Figures</span> <br> <br>
                    There are three key figures of the Old Kingdom (circa 2700–2100 B.C.E.) who drove the development of
                    Egypt’s most famous monument, the pyramid. As the architect to King Djoser (circa 2650–2575 B.C.E.),
                    Imhotep is credited with the development of a six-layer step pyramid at Saqqarah and is the only key
                    figure we cite who is not a ruler. The world’s oldest stone monument, the Step Pyramid, was built
                    over a mastaba, an older form of a rectangular, one-layer tomb in use at the time and is considered
                    the essential first step in the development of the pyramid.

                    It was Snefru (reigned circa 2600 B.C.E.) who covered the ground between a stepped pyramid and a
                    true pyramid, albeit with some issues along the way—such as the limestone casing falling off the
                    Meidum Pyramid and getting the angle wrong on the Bent Pyramid. But with the Red Pyramid at Dashur,
                    he achieved what is widely considered to be the first true pyramid.

                    </span> <br> <br>
                    Ancient Egyptians carved giant statues of Ramesses II and Nefertiti at the Temple of Nefertiti in
                    Abu Simbel, Egypt. As ancient Egyptian rulers, pharaohs were both the heads of state and the
                    religious leaders of their
                    people. The word “pharaoh” means “Great House,” a reference to the palace where the pharaoh resides.
                    While early Egyptian rulers were called “kings,” over time, the name “pharaoh” stuck.

                    As the religious leader of the Egyptians, the pharaoh was considered the divine intermediary between
                    the gods and Egyptians. Maintaining religious harmony and participating in ceremonies were part of
                    the pharaoh’s role as head of the religion. As a statesman, the pharaoh made laws, waged war,
                    collected taxes, and oversaw all the land in Egypt (which was owned by the pharaoh).
